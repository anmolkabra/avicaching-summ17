# Contains the Logs/Plots/Predictions of all Models
---
**This directory is big - around 470 MB as of Aug 8, 17**- comprising of hundreds of `.txt` and `.png` files. These were created when different tests of both the Identification and Pricing Problem's models were run on the test-machine. The directory listing is:

---
* `find_rewards/` - Pricing Problem Stats
    * `logs/` - `.txt` files of logs containing best loss value, execution time, and best rewards along with test specs.
        * `1rand/` - Stats for GPU Speedup on random dataset (when script restricted to 1 CPU thread)
        * `orig/` - Stats for Optimization on original dataset
            * `run_for_best/` - Stats after finalizing a single set of weights, and running tests with different learning rates and seeds
        * `rand/` - Stats for GPU Speedup on random dataset (without restrictions)
    * `plots/` - `.png` files of loss v epoch plots during runs
        * same structure as that of `logs/`
    * `test_rewards_results/` - loss values of different sets of rewards (initialized differently), calculated using the best performing set of weights (see report)
    * `*.txt` - files containing different sets of rewards (initialized differently)
---
* `find_weights/` - Identification Problem Stats
    * `logs/` - `.txt` files of logs containining test loss, test time, train loss, and train time after each epoch, with some run specs
        * `1rand/` - Stats for GPU Speedup on random dataset with 3-layered network (when script restricted to 1 CPU thread) - similar results as in `rand/` (without restriction)
        * `4layer/` - Stats for Optimization on original dataset for the 4-layered network
        * `orig/` - Stats for Optimization on original dataset for the 3-layered network
        * `rand/` - Stats for GPU Speedup on random dataset with 3-layered network (with full access to all CPU threads)
    * `map_plots/` - Visit probability plots vs lat-long based on the model's prediction (see report)
        * `4layer/` - Only few plots to see the results; not used anywhere in the study
        * `orig/` - same description as that of `logs/orig/`
    * `plots/` - `.png` files of test and train loss vs epoch during runs
        * same structure as that of `map_plots/`
    * `weights/` - `.txt` files containing flattened tensors of weights generated by the model - taken in by the Pricing Problem's model
        * same structure as that of `logs/`
    * any other un-grouped files were used is some tests or the other, and I couldn't group them in a specific directory as they were isolated runs
---
* `lp_speedup` - Stats of runs for identifying resource usage trends in the Pricing Problem and the unexpected GPU Speedup in LP runtime (see Appendix B of report)
    * `?cpu_cpuset.txt` - CPU usage logs while `../../test_lp_time.py` was running on CPU "set" with access to ? threads
    * `cpu_cpuset.txt` - same as the previous one but with full CPU thread access
    * `cpu_gpuset.txt` - same as the previous one but with GPU "set"
    * `onlylp.txt` - same as the previous one but with only the LP running - no neural network
    * `cpu, epochs=*` - log of LP execution time at each epoch with CPU "set"
    * `gpu, epochs=*` - same as the previous one but with GPU "set"
    * `onlylp, epochs=*` - same as the previous one but with only the LP running - no neural network
    * `*.csv` - data combined from the above files for plotting in tikz-tex
---
#### Misc files:
* `*.png` - screenshots of GPU usage when a model was running and when it was not - inconsequential files
* `stats_compilation.xlsx` - All stats from all sub-directories combined to give meaningful averages and results
* `*.txt` - specs of the test machine
